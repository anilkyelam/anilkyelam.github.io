## About

<img src="dp3.png" alt="drawing" height="350" style="float:right;margin:0px 5px 5px 5px"/>

I'm a first year Computer Science PhD student at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), advised by Prof. [Alex Snoeren](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~snoeren/). 
I'm also a member of [Systems and Networking](https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/) group, where my current research focus is on understanding the network performance of 
data analytics platforms like Spark, and enabling isolation for hardware-offloaded applications on Smart NICs.
My research interests broadly lie in distributed systems and (high performance) networking.


## Past
I received my bachelors degree from [Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) in 2014. I spent the next four years working at Microsoft as a Software Engineer in Azure SQL Database team, 
building services that support [SQL databases](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-database/) and [SQL Server VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/) on Microsoft Azure.

## On a personal note


I grew up in a [small village](https://goo.gl/maps/EgKhvufCn252) in Southern India where I went to primary school. Since then, I've moved around quite a bit, both in and outside India, starting from Guntur (2006-08), 
Hyderabad (2008-10), Kharagpur (Undergrad, 2010-14), Belgrade (Microsoft Serbia, 2014-16), Seattle (Microsoft Redmond, 2016-18) and San Diego (UC San Diego, 2018-present).
I'm an avid reader and I like literary fiction - [García Márquez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez) is my favorite. Sports-wise, I love (and play!) Tennis.
